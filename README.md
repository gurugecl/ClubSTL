# ClubSTL
Website I built for a friend's business based on a bootstrap course The website is designed to attract customers and revenue for select businesses in St Louis. The skills and languages used in creating this website are html, css, bootstrap, and jquery. I'm working on adding more jquery and angularjs to add functionality to the site
